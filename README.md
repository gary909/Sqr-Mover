"# Sqr-Mover" 

Move a square around the sqreen, styled like an 80's CRT monitor.  The square is limited to the area of the screen.  Collect text, which then falls off the screen (like the text in the matrix).  New text then randomly appears in a different location within the screen area.  Still much more to do!
